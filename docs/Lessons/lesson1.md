## Values

Fundamentally, a program is just a set of computer instructions that tells it how to manipulate values.\
But what is a value?\


A value is information that a computer stores as a certain **data type**
| Col1         | Col2     | Col3          |
| :----------- | :------: | ------------: |
| Left-aligned | Centered | Right-aligned |
| blah         | blah     | blah          |
