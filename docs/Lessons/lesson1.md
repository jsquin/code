## Values

Fundamentally, a program is just a set of computer instructions that tells it how to manipulate values.\
But what is a value?


A value is information that a computer stores as a certain **data type**


| **Data Types** | **Examples**         |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Integers       | ```1``` ```2``` ```35139``` |
| Floats         | ```3.14159265``` ```2.7182182``` |
| Booleans       | ```True``` ```False```           |
| Strings        | ```"Hello World"``` ```'John'``` |

## Expressions

An expression is something that evaluates to values.\
Expression: ```'hello' + ' ' + 'world!'```
Value: ```'hello world!'```


An expression can contain operators (e.g.:```*```, ```+```, ...)\
* ```32 + 15```
* ```355/113```
* ```2 * 100```
* ```2 ** 100```


Try these out in the Notebook below!\
Type an expression into the bottom box then press ```shift``` + ```enter```\
The notebook will evaluate these expressions and print the value

## Call Expressions
Expressions can also use function calls\
```pow(2, 100)``` == 2 ** 100 == $2^{100}$
```max(50, 300)```
```min(-1, 30)```
